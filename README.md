# DirectSearch

<b>Tool that helps you:</b>
 
1. Search directories of a specified target
2. Let you put a custom wordlist
3. Properly segregate the different type of request in different status code.
4. Each Request Code has its own seperate box for better understanding
5. Will tell you the exact Request Code for each link
6. Native commands used from Bash.

<b>Improvement:</b>

I am working on the code itself and if anyone thinks something can be better
or has to be chnaged please do let me know. Will be really glad.

<b>Requirement:</b>

<pre>sudo apt-get install curl</pre>
<pre>sudo apt-get install grep</pre>

<b>Wait till it does the work for you.</b>
